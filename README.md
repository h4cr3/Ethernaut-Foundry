## What is Ethernaut

  Ethernaut is an educational platform for learning about smart contract security on the Ethereum blockchain, developed by the OpenZeppelin team. It consists of a series of challenges that are designed to teach developers about common vulnerabilities and attack vectors in smart contracts.

  The challenges on Ethernaut cover a range of topics, including the Solidity programming language, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), common attack vectors like reentrancy and integer overflow, and best practices for writing secure smart contracts. Each challenge requires the developer to find and exploit a vulnerability in a smart contract, often by using tools like Remix or web3.js to interact with the contract.
